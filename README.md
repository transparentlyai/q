#CONTEXT

```

An example configuration file is provided in the repository as `example_config.conf`.

### Supported Configuration Variables

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key (should start with `sk-ant-api-`)
- `MODEL`: Default model to use (e.g., "claude-3-opus-20240229", "claude-3-haiku-20240307")

⚠️ **Security Warning:** 
- Never include API keys or sensitive information in your context section or context files
- Any text that looks like an API key, or contains words like "api_key", "key", "token", or "secret" will be automatically redacted
- The tool includes safeguards to prevent accidentally sending API keys in context, but use caution with sensitive information
